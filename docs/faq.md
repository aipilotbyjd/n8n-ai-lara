# ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

Comprehensive answers to common questions about the n8n clone workflow automation platform.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Q: What is the n8n clone?

**A:** The n8n clone is a comprehensive workflow automation platform built with Laravel and modern PHP. It provides a visual workflow builder and execution engine that allows users to create complex automation workflows through a drag-and-drop interface, similar to n8n but built specifically for PHP/Laravel ecosystems.

### Q: How is it different from the original n8n?

**A:**
- **Technology Stack**: Built with PHP/Laravel instead of Node.js
- **Database**: Uses relational databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL) instead of document-based storage
- **Architecture**: Follows traditional web application patterns with MVC architecture
- **Integration**: Better integration with PHP/Laravel ecosystem tools
- **Deployment**: Easier deployment in traditional hosting environments

### Q: What are the system requirements?

**A:**
- **PHP**: 8.2 or higher
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13+ or MySQL 8.0+
- **Redis**: 6.0+ (for caching and queues)
- **Node.js**: 18+ (for frontend assets)
- **Composer**: 2.0+
- **RAM**: 4GB minimum, 8GB recommended
- **Storage**: 10GB minimum

### Q: Can I run it on shared hosting?

**A:** Not recommended. The n8n clone requires full server access for:
- Queue workers (background processing)
- Custom PHP configurations
- Redis access
- File system permissions

Use VPS, dedicated hosting, or cloud platforms (AWS, DigitalOcean, etc.) instead.

## üí° Features & Functionality

### Q: What types of workflows can I create?

**A:** You can create workflows for:
- **Data Processing**: ETL operations, data transformation
- **API Integration**: Connect different services and APIs
- **Email Automation**: Send notifications, process incoming emails
- **Database Operations**: CRUD operations across multiple databases
- **File Processing**: Upload, download, process files
- **Scheduled Tasks**: Time-based automation
- **Webhook Processing**: Handle incoming webhooks
- **Business Logic**: Custom decision trees and routing

### Q: What integrations are available?

**A:** The platform includes built-in nodes for:
- **HTTP Requests**: RESTful API calls
- **Database Queries**: MySQL, PostgreSQL operations

Additional integrations can be built as custom nodes.

### Q: Can I create custom nodes?

**A:** Yes! The node system is extensible. You can create custom nodes by:
1. Implementing the `NodeInterface`
2. Registering the node in the `NodeRegistry`
3. Placing the node class in `app/Nodes/Custom/`

Example custom node:
```php
<?php
namespace App\Nodes\Custom;

use App\Nodes\Interfaces\NodeInterface;
use App\Workflow\Execution\NodeExecutionContext;
use App\Workflow\Execution\NodeExecutionResult;

class SlackNotificationNode implements NodeInterface
{
    public function getId(): string { return 'slackNotification'; }
    public function getName(): string { return 'Slack Notification'; }
    public function getCategory(): string { return 'action'; }

    public function getProperties(): array {
        return [
            'channel' => ['type' => 'string', 'placeholder' => '#general', 'required' => true],
            'message' => ['type' => 'string', 'required' => true],
        ];
    }

    public function execute(NodeExecutionContext $context): NodeExecutionResult {
        // Implementation here
    }
}
```

## üîê Security & Access

**A:** The platform supports multi-tenancy through:
- **Organizations**: Top-level tenant isolation
- **Teams**: Sub-groups within organizations
- **User Roles**: Organization-level and team-level permissions
- **Data Isolation**: Database-level tenant separation
- **Resource Limits**: Per-organization resource quotas

## üöÄ Performance & Scaling
